This is a web app that allows you detect the faces in an image, with the power of machine learning.
the frontend was created using reactjs, the face detection is done using clarifai API, the backend
consists of an expressjs server, and the database being used is PostgreSQL. The app is hosted on
heroku as well as on github pages.
